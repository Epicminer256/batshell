# batShell
This is a small little batch script that works like cmd, but can be customized to work the way you want it. Commands like "ls" and "clear" work by default. batShell also has a feature to edit itself with the command "editconf" and can restart itself with "reset". 

There is also a "app" command that will launches apps that are installed on your computer (like the program "chrome") and will also launch files and programs in the folder "apps". Also there a command called "cdconf" that changes the directory into the folder that the shell.bat is in.

if you want to add apps, use the "addapp" command. The "addapp" is a script editor for batshell that edits batshell.

You can also add any file inside your app folder such as exe files, batch files, pictures, video files, links to websites, and shortcuts to apps.


If you want to use batshell instead of cmd, here is how you kinda half-way install batShell

1.) Make sure you have batShell somewhere else besides your downloads folder (it is reccomended to put batShell in its own folder in your documents folder)

2.) Right click shell.bat and goto "Send To"

3.) Send it to "Desktop (create link)"

4.) Navigate to your deskop and rename it to batShell

5.) Copy the newly created link and goto "%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs"

6.) Make a folder called "batShell and paste the batShell shortcut into it"

7.) Done! it should pop up in your start menu. If it isnt there you might need to relogin

You can right click the shortcut and click "Properties" and click "Change Icons" to change the icon on the start menu
Unfortanly I cant put a install script in due to there not having a shortcut command that the start menu will work with.
