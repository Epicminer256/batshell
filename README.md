# batShell
This is the unstable branch of batShell. This might be seperate from the main batShell due to the other shell being only one file

  The unstable version of batShell is made to easly customize your shell with ez and to conviently add programs to your command line without having to jump though hoops to get it working. If you want say a minecraft server. just type a command called "app", then type in what name your command will have. Then, a notepad window will pop up. put in your command in this window and save it. Now just type in the command.

  Want some cool colors on your prompt, just type "editconf" and change the color value there. Want the starting prompt message changed, edit the file in your cfg folder called "prompt.cmd"

If you want to use batshell instead of cmd, here is how you kinda half-way install batShell

1.) Make sure you have batShell somewhere else besides your downloads folder (it is reccomended to put batShell in its own folder in your documents folder)

2.) Right click shell.bat and goto "Send To"

3.) Send it to "Desktop (create link)"

4.) Navigate to your deskop and rename it to batShell

5.) Copy the newly created link and goto "%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs"

6.) Make a folder called "batShell and paste the batShell shortcut into it"

7.) Done! it should pop up in your start menu. If it isnt there you might need to relogin

You can right click the shortcut and click "Properties" and click "Change Icons" to change the icon on the start menu
