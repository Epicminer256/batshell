# batShell
This is a small little batch script that works like cmd, but can be customized with ez. Commands like "ls" and "clear" work by default. batShell also has a feature to edit itself with the command "editconf" and can restart itself with "reset". 

There is also a "app" command that will launches apps that are installed on your computer (like the program "chrome") and will also launch programs in the folder that the shell.bat file is in (if you have a file that is in the same folder as shell.bat called "image.png" or a link file called "steam"). 

Also made a command called "cdconf" that changes the directory into the folder that the shell.bat is in.
