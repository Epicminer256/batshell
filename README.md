# batShell
This is a small little batch script that works like cmd, but can be customized with ez. Commands like "ls" and "clear" work by default. batShell also has a feature to edit itself with the command "editconf" and can restart itself with "reset". 

There is also a "app" command that will launches apps that are installed on your computer (like the program "chrome") and will also launch programs in the folder that the shell.bat file is in (if you have a file that is in the same folder as shell.bat called "image.png" or a link file called "steam"). 

Also made a command called "cdconf" that changes the directory into the folder that the shell.bat is in.

If you want to use this instead of the shell, here is how you kinda half-way install batShell

1.) Make sure you have batShell somewhere else besides your downloads folder (it is reccomended to put batShell in its own folder in your documents folder)

2.) Right click shell.bat and goto "Send To"

3.) Send it to "Desktop (create link)"

4.) Navigate to your deskop and rename it to batShell

5.) Copy the newly created link and goto "%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs"

6.) Make a folder called "batShell and paste the batShell shortcut into it"

7.) Done! it should pop up in your start menu. If it isnt there you might need to relogin

You can right click the shortcut and click "Properties" and click "Change Icons"
